# About Me

I'm a techno-creative with broad interest in generative art, cryptography, economics, and the nature of work.

My commercial expertise lies in financial, e-commerce, media streaming, and game software.

I'm currently interested in human-centric device programming (EEG, ERG, et al.) and the advent of personal software.
